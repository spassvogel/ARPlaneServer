#How to run the server?

```
$ cd "DarkRift Server (.NET Framework)"
$ mono DarkRift.Server.Console.exe
```

This will use the plugins in the `Plugins` folder.

#How to edit code
After editing code, build for *Release*. The solution has been configured to output the .dll to the `Plugins` directory. Then cancel and restart `DarkRift.Server.Console`.
